                                            <p>
                                                <br>
                                                What can we do to become healthier?
                                                <br>
                                                
                                                We know, from various studies, that there is a dual relationship between the body and mind, with both mutually influencing each other. Therefore, by improving our physical health through healthy exercise practices and balanced eating habits, we can improve our mental well-being. To become healthier individuals, we need to be able to listen carefully to what our body is telling us. This involves adopting a flexible diet that is adjusted to our goals, metabolism, and physiology, along with an active lifestyle.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                What are the main causes of depression, anxiety, and eating disorders?
                                                <br>
                                                
                                                What we consume can be one of the causes of the onset of psychopathological illnesses. The way we eat, or rather, the relationship we have with food, if viewed negatively, can also become a factor that contributes to the development of eating disorders and compulsions. These psychopathologies, or their consequences, are increasingly common diseases today, largely caused by the pandemic we have been living in for over a year, and the beauty standards that society mirrors on social media as real.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                How can we use food to avoid the onset of psychopathologies?
                                                <br>
                                                
                                                Fortunately, by viewing food as our ally, we can be healthy and balanced individuals through careful nutrition that includes the minerals and vitamins necessary for the proper functioning of our brain and body. In order to avoid the onset of these psychological disorders, foods that are rich in tryptophan are recommended, such as nuts, eggs, oats, milk, tuna, cheese, bread, chicken meat, and chocolate. Tryptophan is an amino acid and one of the components of living organisms' proteins that is essential for human nutrition. Together with vitamin B3 and magnesium, it produces serotonin (a hormone that acts on the central nervous system and causes a sense of well-being).
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                How can we acquire more knowledge about nutrition to better preserve our mental health?
                                                <br>
                                                
                                                This is a time when we need to be increasingly aware of all the signs our body gives us, especially in terms of mental health, as "Among psychiatric disorders, anxiety disorders have the highest prevalence (16.5%)" (SPPSM). Therefore, it is essential that we are informed and acquire the necessary knowledge about food and the best way to eat, which will help us prevent and control psychological disorders. The Do It Better training center offers the opportunity to invest in your knowledge, profession, and, above all, your health through the Nutrition, Dietetics, and Parapharmacy course.

                                                I created this Facebook post to promote the hairdresser professional course. For these types of posts the company required me to use this green template with the company‚Äôs logo, I then had the idea to go to the classrooms and take photos of the students, and edited them into the template. This is the caption that I wrote translated to English:
